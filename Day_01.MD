## Day 01 - Complex Numbers and Linear Algebra Basics



### Cheatsheet

- Vector
  
  - Vector addition
  
  - Scalar Multiplication

- Linear Combination
  
  - eg: i and j --> (3)i + (-4)j

- Basis (i,j)

- Span (Set of vectors you can reach from the linear combination of two vectors)

- Matrices
  
  - Matrix addition
  
  - Matrix multiplication

<u>Linear transformation:</u>

A transformation **L** is linear if it satisfies the following two properties:
        1. L(a + b) = La + Lb

        2. L(ca) = cL(a)

            N.B. **a,b** are vectors and **c** is a scalar.
